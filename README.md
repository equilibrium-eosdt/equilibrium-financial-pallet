# Financial Pallet

_This project is currently under active development._

## Overview

Equilibrium's financial pallet is an open-source substrate module that subscribes to external price feed/oracle, gathers asset prices and calculates financial metrics based on the information collected.  

## Documentation

For the detailed documentation please refer to [docs/FINANCIAL.md](docs/FINANCIAL.md).

## Installation

Make sure you have done all steps described in [Installation page](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/getting-started/) of the Substrate Developer Hub.

To build project run:

```bash
cargo build
```

## Tests

To run unit tests type:

```bash
cargo test
```

You can see unit test report [here](docs/test-report.txt).

In case you want run code coverage tool, please follow [instructions](https://github.com/xd009642/tarpaulin#installation) to install tarpaulin.

To create code coverage report run:

```bash
cargo tarpaulin -v
```

You can see code coverage report [here](docs/tarpaulin-report.html).

To run integration tests you need purge and run node first (see the next section for more information).

Then type:

```bash
cargo run -p integration-testing
```

Note that integration tests take several minutes to complete.

## Running the Node

First of all please ensure that your development chain's state is empty:

```bash
cargo run --bin node-template purge-chain --dev
```

Now you can start the development chain:

```bash
cargo run --bin node-template --dev
```

### Connecting Explorer

It can be very useful to connect UI to the node you just started.

To do this open https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer in your browser first.

Follow these steps to register required custom types:

* In the main menu choose Settings tab;
* In the Settings submenu choose Developer tab;
* Copy content of the [custom-types.json](custom-types.json) file into text box on the page;
* Press Save button.

## Development Roadmap

| Milestone # | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Initial implementation, subscription to oracle |
| 2 | Returns, volatilities, and correlation calculations |
| 3 | Portfolio volatility calculations, Value at Risk calculations |

## Future Plans

The Financial pallet will be further used in Equilibriumâ€™s DeFi parachain for the risk and pricing models to calculate interest rate fees, assess borrower portfolio risks and overall system risks. 

We have a plan of the further financial pallet evolution that will add complex and non-parametric ways of volatility, correlation and portfolio risk estimations. We will offload heavy calculations in some of these methods to designated off-chain worker.

Following additional methodologies/calculations will be introduced: EWMA, GARCH, Garman-Klass volatility estimates, as well as GARCH, CVaR, Monte-Carlo simulation, Historical simulation, and Copula methods for assessing value at risk.
